Hello. I am a second year student at the University of Chicago majoring in Computer Science. 
My research interests lie in computational neuroscience, and more broadly, applying machine learning and computational methods to studying how the brain works.
Besides research, I enjoy listening to music, playing electrical guitar, and gaming.
