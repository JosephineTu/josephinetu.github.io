Hello. I am a second year student at the University of Chicago studying computer science and computational neuroscience. 
My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience-especially when it is about human and computer vision, but I am also actively exploring other related fields.
Besides research, I enjoy playing the guitar and ACGN culture.
